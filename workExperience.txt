LAIC STUDENT SUPERVISOR, NDSU IT DEPARTMENT
After I completed my time as the Turning Point Intern, I was selected to move into the position of Student Supervisor when the previous one was leaving. This job has seen me schedule our 6 employees who comprised both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as scheduling our workshops every month while still being able to help any students or faculty that come in for help. This job has taught me a lot, especially in the fields of time management as well as employee relations.
