Hello, my name is Drew Grondahl and I am currently am Associate Technical Consultant at Perficient Inc. and I studied Computer Science at NDSU.

In my time at NDSU I was apart of our Cybersecurity Club on campus, our chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), as well as our Robotics team.
    
    On the robotics team in the Fall/Winter of 2019/2020, I was part of our autonomous snowplow project, which saw me help build the robot as well as design and 3D print components for the robot. My biggest piece I did was the housing to the front facing sensor, which presented unique challenges such as protecting it without covering the sensor, as well as the non-standard positioning of the screw holes on the back.
    In our Cybersecurity club, it was structured so that the students would be the ones presenting all the new topics. It was partly this that brought me to it, so when I got the chance, I made sure I gave a presentation myself, which I did on Raspberry Pi microcontrollers. In this club I also took part in National Cyber League (NCL) competitions. These were weekend long competitions that centered around problem solving and programming to reach the goal and find the key hidden in the problem.
    I joined our ACM branch so that I would have a place to meet other Computer Science majors, as well as other people who are interested in computers. There I was a part of programming competitions such as one at DigiKey electronics, and Mechmania (a weekend long competition to build a program to compete in a game tournament against teams from other universities) as well as interior projects such as the instillation of new furniture, categorization of all the excess hardware and replacement of computer parts in our local desktops. Also, in the ACM I took on an official position of Chapter Librarian, where I would be in charge of all the books in our chapters' library.
